# Curatorial

Curatorial is an artworks API. It was built with Ruby on Rails and seeded with artworks from the Harvard Art Museum's API at the `/artworks` endpoint. Each artwork was then submitted to the Google Vision API to be analysed for its content. The response from Google Vision has been stored at the `/contents` endpoint.
